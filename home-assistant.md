# Home Assistant Configuration

I have an automation with my WLED controller to automate holiday-specific presets/playlists based on the day.

To facilitate this automation, I also have some Helpers and a HACS integration to keep things clean.

I have some triggers repeated with small offsets, that's a hacky way to try the command twice if the first fails silently. 

```yaml
alias: Holiday Roof Lights üè†

  - platform: sun
    event: sunset

    id: sunset

## HACS Integration: next_holiday

GitHub: [partofthething/next-holiday-sensor](https://github.com/partofthething/next-holiday-sensor)

As a part of 2024.01 Home Assistant, an official `holiday` integration was added. I was going to switch, but the benefit of this custom approach is that I can also add in Halloween, and family birthdays that I also would want to trigger holiday-specific automations.

## Helpers

### Independence Day

`binary_sensor.independence_day_holiday`

```yaml
{{ 
   states('sensor.next_holiday') == 'Independence Day'
   and 
   state_attr('sensor.next_holiday','days_until_next_holiday') == 0
}}
```

### Halloween

`binary_sensor.halloween_holiday`

```yaml
{{ 
   states('sensor.next_holiday') == 'Halloween'
   and 
   state_attr('sensor.next_holiday','days_until_next_holiday') == 0
}}
```

### Thanksgiving

`binary_sensor.thanksgiving_holiday`

```yaml
{{ 
   states('sensor.next_holiday') == 'Thanksgiving' 
   and 
   state_attr('sensor.next_holiday','days_until_next_holiday') == 0
}}
```

### Christmas Holiday 

`binary_sensor.christmas_holiday`

```yaml
{{ 
  (
    states('sensor.next_holiday') == 'Christmas Day' 
    and 
    state_attr('sensor.next_holiday','days_until_next_holiday') < 35
  ) 
  
  or
  
  states('sensor.next_holiday') == 'Christmas Day (Observed)'
  
  or
  
  (
    states('sensor.next_holiday') == 'New Year\'s Day'
    and 
    state_attr('sensor.next_holiday','days_until_next_holiday') > 1
  )
  
  or
   
  states('sensor.next_holiday') == 'New Year\'s Day (Observed)')

  or
   
  states('sensor.next_holiday') == 'Martin Luther King Jr. Day'
}}
```

### New Year's Holiday

`binary_sensor.new_years_holiday`

```yaml
{{ 
  (
    states('sensor.next_holiday') == 'New Year\'s Day'
    and 
    state_attr('sensor.next_holiday','days_until_next_holiday') <= 1
  )
  
  or

  states('sensor.next_holiday') == 'New Year\'s Day (Observed)'
}}
```
